# Relay Module 1 Relay - 5V 30A

This is 1 channel Relay module, can able to control various  appliances, and other equipment with a BIG current for 30A  (250VAC/30VDC).It can be controlled directly by microcontroller:  Raspberry, Arduino, AVR, PIC, DSP, ARM or TTL logic.For control of  module need power 5V and logic operation 3.3V/5V.For isolate the  microcontroller from the relay, an optocouplerhas been added. Now with  this configuration, the microcontroller doesnâ€™t have any physical  connection with the relay, it just uses the LED light of the Optocoupler IC to activate the relay. This solution saves your microcontroller from a high voltage for VAC/VDC.
